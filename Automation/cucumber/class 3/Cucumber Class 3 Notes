Cucumber Class 3

	Feature File - in this file we describe behavior of the system/ writing our test cases in Gherkin format using Gherkin keywords:
		Given - precondition
		When - action
		Then - result/outcome
		And  - continious precondition/action/result
	
	Step Definitions  - we define steps from feature file/write code using Selenium/Java. We have only 1 definition per step

	Runner Class - execution class to run specific/all features
	Here we define cucumber options (test configurations)
	dryRun - check if all steps have been implemented
	monochrome - makes console output more readable
	tags - specify which particular scenario/scenarios we want ot run/skip
	glue - path to step definitions
	features - path to feature file we want to execute
	plugin - we can specify different type of plugins for our reports
	To run our test cases we need TestNG or JUnit and we are using JUnit to run tests and do assertions

Hooks - block of code that will be executed before and after each scenario in each feature file (hooks are global concept that works for every scenario in the entire project)

Hooks are placed inside step definitions, howevee they DO NOT provide denition to any of the steps. 

Feature defines the flow of the test case/execution
Step Definition simply contains of tagged methods and based on the step it find matching tagged method and then code inside that method is getting executed

Background Keyword - used if you have any repetitive steps (begiining/precondition) in your feature file, then those step can be placed under Background. (Local concept/means it is local ONLY FOR THAT PARTICULAR feature file)

Let's say 2 scenario need to be executed from same feature file
	Hooks(@Before)--> Background-->steps in first scenario-->Hooks(@After)

	Hooks(@Before)--> Background-->steps in second scenario-->Hooks(@After)

To perform DDT in cucumber we can use
	1. Scenario Outline  - we have to define Examples keyword where we specify our test data. And based on the amount of test data ENTIRE Scenario will get executed #times

HW:
1. Automate  Scenario: Add Employee and Create Login Details
2. Complete Scenario: Add Employee Labels Verification--> compare 2 ArrayList
