Maven  - is build automation tool for Java projects (Gradle, Ant)

Why Automation testers use it:
1. Build project structure (folders)
2. Manage Dependencies
3. Run automations scripts from command line

Maven is a command line tool
To create Maven Project

File--> New Project--> Maven --> Maven Project--> select chkbox to create simple project --> 
			groupId == company/organization (com.syntax)
			ArtifactId == projectName (TestNgFramework)
			--> click finish

In your maven project:

	main - application code

	test - test code

	pom.xml - this is the heart of the maven project where we will store all configurations 

	target - anything generated by Maven(compiled code and reports)


POM - Page Object Model - is a design pattern (	NOT A FRAMEWORK)
Main concept:
	for each webpage we will build separate java class where we will store all page related elements and methods that can be performed


POM can be achieved in 2 ways:
	without PageFactory
	with PageFactory
