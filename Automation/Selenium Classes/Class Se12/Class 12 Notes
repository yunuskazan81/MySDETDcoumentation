To take screesnot in Selenium we use TakesScreenShot interface

1. TakesScreenShot ts=(TakeScreenShot)driver;
2. File src=ts.getScreenShotAs(OutputType.File);
3. FileUtils.copyFile(src, dest);

Upload & Download
The simpliest way to upload file is to use .sendKeys(path to file)
or use Robot class from Selenium, or other tools such as AutoIT or Sikuli

JavaScriptExecutor

If click or send keys doesnt work we can use JS to perform action on that element. Also we can scroll up and down the page.

JavaScriptExecutor js=(JavaScriptExecutor)driver;
js.executeScript("...", " ");

Advanced xPath

If element doesn not have unique identification we can isendtified based on the 

1. Parent - if parent is unique then we can easily traverse to child and identified

parenXpath/childTagName

2. Child - if child element is uniques then we can easily identify parent/ grandParent

chilXpath/.. --> parent /.. --> will take to grandParent

3. Siblings:

Preceding: if the older sibling doesnt have unique identification, then we can

	yongerXpath/preeding-sibling::olderTagName

Following: if the yonger sibling doesnt have uniques identification then that element can be identified based on the older sibling

	olderXpath/following-sibling::yongerTagName

XPATH for 2 row and 3 column

//table/tbody/tr[2]/td[3]
