API Class 1:

Application Architechture:

1 Tier/Layer - desktop (client + server available on 1 system) 
2 Tier/Layer - client + database server (located on separate system)
3 Tier/Layer - client  + application server + database server
		presentation layer/ bussiness/ application layer/ data layer

Any application that travels through HTTP (web) = 3 tier 

Client - is computer/program that access UI

Presentation Layer --> GUI --> will use HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Application Layer --> will use Java using Spring Framework, C# using .NET framework, Python ...
Data Layer --> Database: Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server..

To test presentation Layer --> GUI we use QTP/UFT or Selenium tools
To test application Layer --> API we use RestAssured tools for automation and for manual we will use PostMan or SoapUi/SoapUi Pro

To test data Layer --> DataBase we use JDBC

in API we always talk about communication

CLIENT --> SERVER
Request --> Response

API are of different types:
1) 
Selenium APIs
JDBC APIs
RestAssured APIs --> this APIs available in a form of Jars

2) APIs that travel through the Web called WebServices (Exanging data between 2 system happens through the Web).

All WebServices are APis , but not all APIs are WebServices.

2 Type of WebServices:
	SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocol	
			Data Exhanges only in XML format

	REST - Representational State Transfer
		Data Exhanges different formats: JSON, XML, Text, Html ...

Different HTTP methods that support in REST

POST	--> 	C - Create = Insert
GET		--> 	R - Retrieve = Select
PUT		--> 	U - Update = Update
DELETE	--> 	D - Delete = Delete
