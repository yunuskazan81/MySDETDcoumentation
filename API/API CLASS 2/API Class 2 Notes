API Class 2:
Recap;

Application Architecture: 1, 2, 3
API - middle man, connectivity, program that allows 2 different systems to communicate and exchange data

WEbService - is an API that travels through Web/Internet

Every WS is an API
Not every API is WS

Types of WS:
	SOAP - uses XML to exchange data. SOAP is heavier and slow, but more secure
	REST - uses many formats: JSON, XML, TEXT. REST is lighweight, fast, but less secure

REST API, Restful WS
REST support HTTP methods:
	GET - retrives data from DB = Select
	POST - creates new record in DB = Insert
	PUT - updates/modifies existing record = Update
	DELETE - deletes record from db =Delete

CRUD operations = DML commands

To test REST APIs we use:
	manually : PostMan,SoapUi
	Automation: RestAssured, HttpClient ....

In API we alway send request and the validate response

In response we have:

	status code: 200, 201, 400, 404
	body : in JSON or XML or Text format

JSON - JavaScript Oject Notation
		file used to exchange data b/w 2 systems

In JSON we have {}, []

{} --> JSON Object
[] --> Array of JSON Objects

Swagger - documentation of your REST APIs.

2 type of parameters:
	path - continue of your endpoin using / - to find your unique resource
	query - comes after your path parameter and starts with ?key=value - to filter/sort items in your result
