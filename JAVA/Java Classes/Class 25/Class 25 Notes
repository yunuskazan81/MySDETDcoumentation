dataTypes in Java:
1. primitive: byte-> short-> int->float->double-> long; boolean, char
2. non-primitive: String ,Object etc

Type Casting in Java:- changing a type of variables to another

1. Implicit / Automatic/ Widening /UpCasting
2. Explicit / Manual / Narrowing /Downcasting
When we try to put small things in a bigger box→ it is ok
When we try to put big thing in a small box→ it is NOT ok

Method Overriding:
1. Inheritance (Parent --> Child replationship)
2. Same method name in Parent and Child Class
4. Parameters and Sequence of parameters MUST BE SAME
	(METHOD SIGNATURE MUST BE SAME)
5. Return Type MUST BE SAME
6. Access modifiers --> CANNOT BE MORE restrictive than in Parent Class
(Private methods cannot be overriden since they do not participate in inheritance);
7. STATIC METHOD CANNOT BE OVERRIDEN
	(while calling method using super class reference you will get an access ONLY to the parent class method--> METHOD HIDING)
8. CAN WE OVERRIDE A CONSTRUCTOR? - NO
9. CAN WE OVERRIDE A FINAL METHOD? - NO

MUST LOOK OVER THIS/This() AND SUPER KEYWORDS/Super()
