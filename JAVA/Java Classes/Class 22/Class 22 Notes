Car obj = new Car();
Car - CLASS NAME
obj - REFERENCE VARIABLE/OBJECT NAME
 =  - ASSIGNING OPERATOR
new - KEYWORD THAT CREATES AN OBJECT
Car() - CONSTRUCTOR 

Constructor will initialize Object and it will give default values to all uninitialized variables(global);

String/Object - null
int - 0
boolean - false

If you do not create ANY CONSTRUCTOR --> COMPILER WILL CREATE 1 DEFAULT CONSTRUCTOR FOR YOU

if you create a constructor--> COMPILER WILL NOT CREATE DEFAULT CONSTRUCTOR FOR YOU

The main role of constructor is to initialize instance variables

We cannot make a cosntructor as static
When we make a private constructor, we can instanciate the class within itself, but won't be able to instantiate it in different classes.

CONSTRUCTOR VS METHOD:
DIFFERENCES:
1. Constructor MUST be same name as a class, whereas method can have ANY name.
2. Constructor CANNOT have a return type not even void, whereas method MUST have return type.
3. Constructor CANNOT BE static, whereas methods can be static or non static.
4. Constructor is getting calles AUTOMATICALLY, whereas methods needs to be called.
4. If we do not define a Constructor --> compiler will create 1 default for you, whereas for methods compiler WON'T create it

SIMILARITY:
1. Both Constructors & Methods HAVE/MIGHT NOT HAVE parameters
2. Access modifiers can be used

JAVA OOPS:
1. Inheritance
2. Polymorphism
3. Encapsulation
4. Abstraction

Inheritance:
Parent Class/Super Class/Base Class
Child Class/Sub Class / Derived Class
