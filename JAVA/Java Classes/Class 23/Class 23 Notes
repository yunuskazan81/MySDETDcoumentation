Polymorphism - ability of Object to take/have many forms/behaviours

2 types of polymorphism:
1. compile time polymorphism/static binding/early binding--> achieved through METHOD OVERLOADING
2. runtime polymorphism/dynamic binding/late binding--> achieved trhough METHOD OVERRIDING

OVERLOADING: - METHOD - (by changing #of parameters OR dataType of 	parameters)
			 - CONSTRUCTOR

IQ: can we overload a constructor?
	-yes (by changing #of parameters OR dataType of parameters)

IQ: can we overload a main method?
	-yes (by changing #of parameters OR dataType of parameters)
