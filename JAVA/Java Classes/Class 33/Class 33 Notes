Class 33

Set stores value not based on index

To retrieve all avlues from a Set

1. For Each Loop / Advance Loop
		
		for (type varName: collectionName){
			SOPln(varName);
		}
2. Iterator

	Iterator<type> varName=collectionName.iterator();
	while (varName.hasNext()){
		SOPln(varName.next());
	}

There are 3 classes that implements Set:
1. HashSet - no duplicate and doesnt maintain the order
2. LinkedHashSet - no duplicates and maintain the order
3. TreeSet  - no duplicates orders based on values (0-9)(A-Z)

ArrayList vs HashSet
1. ArrayList allows duplicates vs HashSet does NOT
2. ArrayLIst preserves the order vs HashSet does NOT
3. ArraList implements List inetrafce vs HashSet implement SET
4. Elements stored based on index vs in HashSet stored based on hashCode

Map is an interface that stores objects based on key+value pair
Key+Value = Entry

Map is a collection of Entries
There are 4 classes implements Map Interface:
1. HashMap: does not mainatin the insertion order
2. LinkedHashMap : preserve insertion order
3. TreeSet : orders based on values (0-9) )(A-Z)
4. Hashtable: 
 
Entry is an Inner Interface of a Map and it has following methods:
1. getKey() - > retun the Object Key of the Entry
2. getValue() -> return the Object Value of the Entry
