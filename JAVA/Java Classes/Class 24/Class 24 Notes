CLASS 24

Method Overloading:
public class Test {
	public void test(){
		SOPln("I am public method");
	}

	protected void test(){
		SOPln("I am protected method");
	}

	void test(){
		SOPln("I am default method");
	}

	private test(){
		SOPln("I am private method");
	}
}
When we overload we talk ONLY about method SIGNATURE(name of the method and parameters) and it need to be DIFFERENT

METHOD OVERLOADING KEY POINTS:
1. Methods having same name within 1 Class
2. Method signature MUST be DIFFERENT
3. Possible by changing: 1. type of parameters
						2. number of the parameters
4. In overloading we DO NOT have any restriction for access modifiers
5. We CAN OVERLOAD STATIC method

1. Can you overload a private method - YES
2. Can you overload a static method - YES

METHOD OVERLOADING - the same method name in 1 Class
METHOD OVERRIDING - the same method in 2 different class (Parent--Child)

method in Parent Class--> overriden method
method in Child Class --> overriding method

In method OVERRIDINNG METHOD SIGNATURE MUST BE SAME (name & parameters)
