Class 27

this() & super() - can be used woth constructors to call current//parent class onstructos. Always have to be the 1 statement in the constructor.

4 Pillar/ Main OOPS concepts in programming:
1. Inheritance - proccess when child/derived/subclass inherots all 			properties and behavours from the parent/base/super class.
	Supported by Java Classes:
	a) Single
	b) MultiLevel
	b) Hierarchial

	Supported by Java Interfaces:
	c) Multiple
	d) Hybrid

2. Polymorphism - 
	a) compile time/static /early binding -> achieved 			through method overloading (same method name and different 				parameters withing same class)
	b) run time / dynamic/ late binding -> achieved through method overriding (same method name and parameters within Parent-Child class)

3. Abstraction - proceess of hiding implementation details and showing 		only importatnt info to the user

	Two ways to achieve abstarction:
	1. Abstract class - is a class in Java that is created using abstract keyword and it can have implemented and unimplemented methods (methods that do not have a body). 
	2. Interface - 

4. Incapsulation
