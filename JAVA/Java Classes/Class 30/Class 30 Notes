Class 30

Array -  allows to store multiple values of same type.

		int[] array= {10, 20, 30, 40};
		int[] intArray=new int[3];//size of an array
		intArray[0]=10;
		intArray[1]=20;
		intArray[2]=30;

Limitation of an Array
1. Size is fixed - we cannot changed once we declare it
2. Can store only homogeneous values

Collection - is a group of objects represented as a single entity
(group of student objects, group of pen)

Wrapper Classed used to wrap primitive data types and present them as an object

for each primitive dataType we have respective WrapperClass

To represent group of Objects we have a collection:
Collection consist of: Interface
						Classes

Methods of All COLLECTIONS:
.add - adding an obejct to the collection
.size - getting a size of the collection

LIST - is an ORDERED Collection that can have duplicate values

Methods of ArrayList:
.get(index) - accessing an element at the specified index
.set(index, value) - replace value at specified index

Benefits of a Collection:
1. Dynamic is size
2. Can store homogeneous and heterogeneous values
3. There are pleanty of methods available to manipulate data in your collection
