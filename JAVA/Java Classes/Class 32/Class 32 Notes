Class 32

Collection  - container object that stores group of objects
			- group of objects represented a s single unit

Homogeneous  - objects from same class
Heterogenous  - objects from different class
Element  - object that is stored inside the collection

We can store ONLY Objects inside the collection

Iterator is USED ONLY with Collections to retrieve element 1 by 1 and 
it iterates ONLY in 1 Direction. Iterator has 3 methods: hasNext(), next(), remove().

ArrayList vs Array
1. ArrayList is a dynamic in size (dynamic data structure) while array is a fixed size (static data structure)
2. ArrayList can store ONLY objects, while array can store object AND primitives
3. ArrayList has a ready methods to remove, add, set (manipulate data) 
while array Does NOT have (you have to write your own logic to manipulate with Data)
4. To find number of elements inside the ArrayList we have method .size(), while in array we have attribute .length

Collection vs Collections
Collection  - container object while Collections - utility class(helper class)
Utility class will have only static methods and you cannot create an Object(cannot instantiate because it has private constructor)
